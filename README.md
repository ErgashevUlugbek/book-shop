This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.1.

## JSON Server

Run `npm install -g json-server` to install json-server globally. We will use it for fake REST API.
Run `json-server --watch db.json` to use the REST API. Make sure you are same folder in cmd with db.json.
In our case it is located at "src/assets".
